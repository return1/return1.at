About
#####

My name is Dominique Lederer, and I have been a web developer since 1999/2000. Having worked for renowned corporate
clients from the start (like Telekom Austria, Allianz, o2 or Red Bull), and after completing my studies at FH Technikum
Wien (Information and Communication Systems and Services), I became self-employed in 2007, in order to offer my clients
first-hand quality.

Focusing on current and reliable technologies, I design, develop and maintain web applications. With constant education
and training, I make sure to retain the cutting edge.
